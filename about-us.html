<h1> About Us</h1>
<p>Public Law 106-50 established a contracting goal for Federal agencies to award 3% of prime
contracts to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs). In addition, large
Prime Contractors have SDVOSB subcontracting goals.</p>

<p>Presidential Executive Order 13360 calls for a significant increase in federal contracting and
subcontracting opportunities for service-disabled veteran-owned businesses. The central
feature of the Executive Order calls for all Federal agencies to develop a strategic plan to
significantly increase its contracting and subcontracting with small businesses owned and
controlled by service-disabled veterans. EO13360 establishes a goal of not less than 3 percent
for participation by service-disabled veteran businesses in Federal contracting.
</p>
<p>The Veterans Benefit Act of 2003 and FAR Subpart 19.14 established the Service-Disabled
Veteran-Owned Small Business Procurement Program. Contracting Officers can set aside
procurements for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses and under certain
conditions can award sole source contracts up to $3 million.</p>

  <h1>Set Asides and Sole Source Awards</h1>
  <p>A solicitation can be set aside for SDVOSBs if the Contracting Officer has a reasonable
  expectation that at least two qualified SDVOSBs will submit offers, and that the contract will be
  awarded at a fair market price. There is no dollar limit on an SDVOSB set aside. If only one offer
  is received, the Contracting Officer may make an award, if the award can be made at a fair
  market price. If the Contracting Officer receives no acceptable offers from service-disabled
  veteran-owned small business concerns, the service-disabled veteran-owned set-aside shall be
  withdrawn and the requirement, if still valid, set aside for small business concerns. Sole-source
  SDVOSB contracts can be awarded if the Contracting Officer determines that only one qualified
  SDVOSB is available to perform the contract, and the anticipated award price of the proposed
  contract, including options, will not exceed: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>$5,500,000 for a requirement within the North American Industry Classification System
(NAICS) code for manufacturing; or</li>
    <li>$3,000,000 for a requirement within all other NAICS codes.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>DOWNLOAD: SDVOSB Contracting Mechanisms</p>

  <p>Who is Eligible: All Federal Agencies that are required to comply with Executive Order 13360, in
which they must direct at least 3 percent of all contracting dollars to small businesses owned by
service-disabled veterans.</p>
